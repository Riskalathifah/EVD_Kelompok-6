# Laptop Specifications and Price Prediction Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **Laptop Specifications and Price Prediction Website**, a final project for the Data Exploration and Visualization course. This interactive web app, built using **R Shiny**, aims to assist users in comparing laptop specifications and predicting prices based on specific attributes using a linear regression model.

## üéØ **Project Overview**
In today‚Äôs digital age, laptops are essential tools for education, work, and leisure. However, the vast range of laptop specifications can make it challenging to find the right one that fits your needs and budget. This project addresses that challenge by providing an easy-to-use web app that:
- Visualizes data for over 700 laptops.
- Allows side-by-side comparison of two laptops.
- Predicts laptop prices based on user-input specifications.

## üöÄ **Features**
1. **Data Visualization**
   - Explore a dataset of laptop specifications through dynamic visualizations.
   - Gain insights into key attributes such as RAM, storage, display resolution, and CPU performance.

2. **Laptop Comparison**
   - Compare two laptops side by side.
   - View detailed specifications to make informed decisions.

3. **Price Prediction**
   - Predict laptop prices based on user-input features.
   - Leverages a linear regression model to estimate prices using attributes such as:
     - Display resolution (pixel density)
     - Internal storage capacity
     - RAM
     - CPU thread count
     - Laptop height

## üßÆ **Price Prediction Model**
The price prediction is based on the following linear regression formula:

\[
\text{Laptop Price} = -6.84893 + (1.66461 \times \text{Pixel Density}) + (0.13425 \times \text{Internal Storage}) + (0.22302 \times \text{RAM}) + (0.38278 \times \text{CPU Threads}) + (0.34647 \times \text{Height})
\]

## üí° **Future Enhancements**
- Incorporate more advanced machine learning models for better price predictions.
- Expand the dataset to include newer laptop models.
- Add filters for users to search laptops by brand or price range.
